### Objective:
The repository is a learning exercise to:

Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset
Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set
Create notebooks that serve as computational records and document my thought process.
The analysis is divided into four sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository

Identifying the problem and Data Sources
Exploratory Data Analysis
Pre-Processing the Data
Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is malignant or Benign
