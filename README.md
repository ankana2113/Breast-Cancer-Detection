# Breast Cancer Detection

<div>
  <h2>Objective:</h2>
  <p>
    1. Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset. <br>
    2. Evaluate and interpret the results and justify the interpretation based on observed dataset. <br>
    3. Create notebooks that serve as computational and observations. <br>
    4. The analysis is divided into 3 sections, saved in separate juypter notebooks in this repository. <br>

  <h3>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</h3>
  <p>
    Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However, it is mostly
    used in classification problems. In this algorithm, each data item is plotted as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the
    value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes
    very well.
